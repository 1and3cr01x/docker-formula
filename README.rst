Docker

This repository is currently empty. It's here as a place to start collecting ideas and code. Having a repo ready to go lowers the barrier of entry to a simple pull req. If you're familiar with Docker and excited to get it set up via Salt, contributions are welcome!

If you're hoping to control an existing Docker install via Salt take a look at the new Docker execution module and Docker state module.
